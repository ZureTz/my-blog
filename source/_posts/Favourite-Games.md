1. Red Dead Redemption 2! You must play this game. Best graphic even without ray tracing. Best story ever for its kind.

3. Euro Truck Simulator 2! A game that allows you to drive a truck across Europe. It is a simulation game, also provides very detailed control of the truck. You can drive a truck from one city to another, and you can also manage your own trucking company. The game has a very realistic traffic system.
